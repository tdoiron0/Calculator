HOW TO FACTOR POLYNOMIAL
1. Group 
	-Different set of factoring rules for binomials 
2. 

NOTES: 
*Factoring just conversion from add/subtract to multiplication of simplest binomials (no GCF, no exponents)
*Any multiplication statement with a variable in it is a term 


Multiplication Operator Rules:
x + 3x^2
1x + 3x^2
1x^1 + 3x^2
x + 3x^2
Program realizes that can't add and leaves in original form 

2x + 3x^2 
2x^1 + 3x^2
2x + 3x^2 
Program realizes that can't add and leaves in original form 

x^2 + 3x^2
1x^2 + 3x^2
(1+3)x^2
4x^2
Operation finishes successfully
