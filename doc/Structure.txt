-Case Base Class 
  -Virtual factor/simplify/solve for/value/etc functions 
  -Polynomial case class 
  -Theorems classes 
  -
-Problem Class
  -Base problem instruction class
    -Tells how to solve problem 
    -Virtual solve function that returns pointer to answer 
      -Identify case tree (Ex: polynomial over binomial, Ex: trig identity over trig identity)
      -
    -Not defined by client, just there to help future me :)
  -Base data class 
    -Main function is to store data
    -Function class 
      -Member trees[]
        -Root node is equal to operator
          -If name on 1 side, nullptr
        -Each node is an operator
          -Could be add, sub, mult, divi... 
          -Vector of pointers to member base classes 
            -Could be a num, var, frac, function, summation 
            -Most basic data in equation
            -Again, not defined by client for same reason :)
      -Identifier pointers[] 
        -Meant to keep track of variables/functions/any other unknowns 
      -Input pointers[] 
        -Meant to keep track of input variables for easy value setting 
        -Inputs not in unknown pointers list 
      -Name
