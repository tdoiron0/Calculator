*Everything made of operators (exponent = multiplication operator) 
*Search tree for member by type/value 
*Processing members contain data necessary for processing 
*Processing members return processed value from value() function 
*Simplify gives value of root member 
*Cases have functions for specific basic instructions (factor for polynomials) 

*Operators are anything that does processing 
*Identifiers are anything that refer to a value by a name
